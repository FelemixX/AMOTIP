A Perl hash is defined by key-value pairs. Perl stores elements of a hash in such an optimal way that you can look up its values based on keys very fast.
With the array, you use indices to access its elements. However, you must use descriptive keys to access hashâ€™s element. A hash is sometimes referred to as an associative array.
